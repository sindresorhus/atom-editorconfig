# How to contribute

First of all, thank you for stopping by - we would really appreciate if you could support us improving `atom-editorconfig` by giving feedback (:+1: :-1: :memo:), opening new issues :sparkles: or starting pull requests.

If you decide to participate, be kind!


### :traffic_light: Roadmap

Every issue assigned is being worked on, seriously. Issues may be dedicated to milestones, a release should then happen when the superordinate milestone is accomplished.

### :raised_hand: Assign yourself

Let us know that you'd like to contribute in an issue - we will then assign you to it, to show everybody involved that this issue is being worked on.

We're also happy to help you taking the first hurdles on your way to a successful contributor! So if you have any questions on how to help - get in touch! :checkered_flag:

### :sparkles: Fork it

We prefer if you work on your own fork of `atom-editorconfig`, especially if you're going to make a bunch of changes.

### :nail_care: Code Style

We're following the [XO code style](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo) (Tip: `$ xo --fix` can fix many issues).

### :microscope: Create Specs

Create at least one test to let us verify your enhancement or fix. Name your test-file `*-spec.js` and put the into the `spec`-directory. If you need to set up special fixtures, try to put them into the `spec/fixtures`-directory.

A simple example for a test-file is the `spec/base-spec.js`-file. If you need help - get in touch! :open_hands:

### :gift: Pull Requests

Ensure your commit passes `npm test` before generating a pull request, this will save us some time.

We like a clean commit history, so when merging a pull request, either ask the contributors to [squash](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11396069/squash-to-only-one-proper-commit-for-github-pull-request) their commits or do it for them manually.
