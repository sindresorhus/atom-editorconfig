I am a nice person filing an feedback, idea or issue! :heart:

Because I'd like you to take a look on the following unexpected behavior, I...

- [ ] provide a list of installed packages (try `apm list`),
- [ ] provide possibly involved `.editorconfig`-files,
- [ ] described exactly which behavior was **expected** and **what happened** instead and
- [ ] send you some virtual :candy: to make you happy.
